%% Text of abstract

In recent years, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG) has been
making great progress in ab initio nuclear many-body theory. At present, the many-body
operator is generally truncated to two-body in the IMSRG. In order to extend the many-
body truncation to the normal-ordered three-body level, it’s necessary to develop the IM-
SRG(3), which involves a great number of complex calculation processes of many-body
operators. Therefore, writing a computer program to achieve auto-calculation would help
researchers reduce the cost of time and energy on such processes.

To achieve the program, it is necessary to translate the theoretical calculation process
into a series of algorithms and apply these algorithms to the calculation of symbols.Under
the Python platform, based on the computer algebra system provided by SymPy, this
Python package, called combo, can create objects of related classes to indicate the indi-
cators and operators. By applying these objects to a series of algorithms, the combo can
calculate the commutator of two arbitrary many-body operators. Moreover, after solv-
ing the problem above, an interface function matching the Angular Momentum Coupling
Program (AMC) is written and can give the result that coupled the angular momentum.

Specifically, four modules in this package can: a) calculate the product and com-
mutator of two arbitrary many-body operators, b) apply symbols’ rule c) regulate the
expressions and provide some auxiliary functions. d) process the expressions for output.

Based on the functions above, the combo package not only can reproduce the rele-
vant calculational process in the IMSRG but also lays the foundation for the development
of IMSRG(3).This paper introduces the function of each module of this package and il-
lustrates the algorithm’s workflow in some logic diagrams.

{\em Nature of problem:}
The IMSRG achieves success in nuclear physics research.
However, the works to calculate the commutator of normal-ordered operators is  error-prone and would cost a lot of time. And the length of result will grows rapidly as a factorial function.\\
{\em Solution method:}
To calculate the product and commutator of normal-ordered operators, combo uses Wick's theorem to match all possible indicators combinations with the operators and ignore the inappropriate combinations.
Afterwards, combo can splite the previous expression and regulate it. And you can display all attributes that store the result of your behaviour.
Moreover, an interface function is given to match the Angular Momentum Coupling
Program (AMC).
