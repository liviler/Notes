abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IM-SRG), a novel ab initio method for nuclei. The IM-SRG employs a continuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian to decouple the ground state from all excitations, thereby solving the many-body problem. Starting from a pedagogical introduction of the underlying concepts, the IM-SRG flow equations are developed for systems with and without explicit spherical symmetry. We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired decoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on calculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing the system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of the reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and demonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate decoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to Coupled Cluster (CC) wave functions. To put the IM-SRG in context with other many-body methods, in particular many-body perturbation theory and non-perturbative approaches like CC, a detailed perturbative analysis of the IM-SRG flow equations is carried out. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing developments, including IM-SRG calculations with three-nucleon forces, the multi-reference IM-SRG for open-shell nuclei, first non-perturbative derivations of shell-model interactions, and the consistent evolution of operators in the IM-SRG. We dedicate this review to the memory of Gerry Brown, one of the pioneers of many-body calculations of nuclei.}

abstract = {We describe the first version (v1.0.0) of the code ADG that automatically (1) generates all valid Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory (BMBPT) diagrams and (2) evaluates their algebraic expression to be implemented for numerical applications. This is achieved at any perturbative order p for a Hamiltonian containing both two-body (four-legs) and three-body (six-legs) interactions (vertices). The automated generation of BMBPT diagrams of order p relies on elements of graph theory, i.e., it is achieved by producing all oriented adjacency matrices of size (p+1)×(p+1) satisfying topological Feynman’s rules. The automated evaluation of BMBPT diagrams of order p relies both on the application of algebraic Feynman’s rules and on the identification of a powerful diagrammatic rule providing the result of the remaining p-tuple time integral. The diagrammatic rule in question constitutes a novel finding allowing for the straight summation of large classes of time-ordered diagrams at play in the time-independent formulation of BMBPT. Correspondingly, the traditional resolvent rule employed to compute time-ordered diagrams happens to be a particular case of the general rule presently identified. The code ADG is written in Python2.7 and uses the graph manipulation package NetworkX. The code is also able to generate and evaluate Hartree–Fock-MBPT (HF-MBPT) diagrams and is made flexible enough to be expanded throughout the years to tackle the diagrammatics used in various many-body formalisms that already exist or are yet to be formulated.
Program summary
Program Title: ADG Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/6h4xrydwfb.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python2.7 Nature of problem: As formal and numerical developments in many-body-perturbation-theory-based ab initio methods make higher orders reachable, producing and evaluating all the diagrams become rapidly undoable on a handmade basis as both their number and complexity grow quickly, making it prone to mistakes and oversights. Solution method: BMBPT diagrams are encoded as square matrices known as oriented adjacency matrices in graph theory, and then turned into graph objects using the NetworkX package. Checks on the diagrams and evaluation of their time-integrated expression are then done on a purely diagrammatic basis. HF-MBPT diagrams are produced and evaluated as well using the same principle.}
